1. Files
This directory contains the source code for converting the SPHYSICS ascii output files (PART_ijkl) to VTU format for use in ParaView
source code:	PART2VTU_2D.f
make files:	PART2VTU_cvf.mak 
		PART2VTU_gfortran.mak
		PART2VTU_ifort.mak
		PART2VTU_ftn95.mak
batch files:	PART2VTU_windows_cvf.bat
		PART2VTU_windows_ftn95.bat
		PART2VTU_unix_gfortran.bat
		PART2VTU_unix_ifort.bat
		PART2VTU_windows_cygwin_gfortran.bat

2. Running PART2VTU_2D
Which Compilers?
- Under windows the code has been run using the Compaq Visual Fortran (CVF) compiler.
- Under linux the code has been run using the GCC gfortran compiler and the Intel ifort compiler. These compilers along with the GNU Make utility should be available on the machine's default PATH.


(i) COPY PART2VTU batch file
Copy the relevant batch file from this directory to the directory run_directory/CaseN/

Change to directory: run_directory/CaseN/

(ii) COMPILE & RUN PART2VTU EXECUTABLE IN ONE STEP

In directory: run_directory/CaseN/ where N is the number of the case to run.

LINUX/UNIX:
      ./PART2VTU_unix_ifort.bat   OR ./PART2VTU_unix_gfortran.bat

CVF on WINDOWS:
      .\PART2VTU_windows_cvf.bat

FTN95 on WINDOWS:
      .\PART2VTU_windows_ftn95.bat

gfortran on Cygwin (WINDOWS):
      ./PART2VTU_windows_cygwin_gfortran.bat

This compiles and runs the PART2VTU code creating an executable in directory execs/.

3. Plotting PART2VTU output
SPHYSICS comes with routines to plot the results in both Matlab and ParaView 3.  The SPHYSICS code generates the following output files:
PART_ijkl	: Particle Field snap shot, x y z u v w ....
DT		: Output timesteps of PART_ijkl files

Under the following directory run_directory/CaseN/ParaviewFiles/VTU/, PART2VTU generates the following files:
PARTijkl.vtu
VTUinp.pvd

If the directories ParaviewFiles/VTU/ do not exist, they are created in the current working directory for each case, i.e. run_directory/CaseN/

Plotting in ParaView 3:
(i)    In ParaView, use the Pipeline browser to load in the .vtu files.
(ii)   For animations, load only the pvd file in first, click Apply.
(iii)  Use Filters and Threshold, etc., on scalar values, etc., to create desired image.
